# Here I have done the project on Text Sentiment Analysis by using NLP(Natural Language Processing).

# Natural Language Processing, or NLP for short, is broadly defined as the automatic manipulation of natural language, like speech and text, by software.

## The following project contains :- 
1. A dataset on which we have done the analysis(```text_emotions.csv```)
2. Two python notebooks on which Training(```Training.ipynb```) and testing(```Test.ipynb```) is done respectively and a (```Test.py```) file to execute it on a command line. 

## To run the code:
1. Clone the github repository in your computer ```https://github.com/Gokul58/Final-Project-JOVAC-ML-.git```
2. Run ```Training.ipynb``` file 
3. Run ```Test.ipynb``` file for the analysis and you can also change the values for "sentiment" that is given in the dataset
4. That's it.
