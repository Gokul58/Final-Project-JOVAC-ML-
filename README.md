# Here I have done the project on Text Sentiment Analysis by using NLP(Natural Language Processing) under the JOVAC(Job Oriented Value Added Course) which is offered by my college under the guidance of Mr. Ankur Chaturvedi and Mr. Mohit Gupta.

## The following project contains :- 
1. A dataset on which we have done the analysis(text_emotions.csv)
2. Two python notebooks on which Training(```Training.ipynb```) and testing(```Test.ipynb```) is done respectively and a (```test.py```) file to execute it on a command line. 

## To run the code:
1. Clone the github repository in your computer. ```https://github.com/Gokul58/Final-Project-JOVAC-ML-.git```
2. Run ```Training.ipynb``` file .
3. Run ```Test.ipynb``` file for the analysis and you can also change the values for "sentiment" that is given in the dataset
4. That's it.
